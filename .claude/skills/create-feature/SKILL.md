name: create-feature
description: Create a Feature class that composes ECS systems into an ordered pipeline. Registers it in GameplayCoreFeature.
---

Create a Feature for the gameplay feature described below.

Feature name: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

### 1. Find or create the feature folder

Search for `Assets/Code/Gameplay/` and find or create the feature folder.

### 2. Find existing systems

Search for systems in the feature's `Systems/` subfolder to understand what systems need to be composed.

### 3. Generate the Feature file

Create `{Feature}Feature.cs` in the feature folder.

```csharp
using Code.Gameplay.{Feature}.Systems;
using Code.Infrastructure.EntityComponentSystem.Factories;

namespace Code.Gameplay.{Feature}
{
	public sealed class {Feature}Feature : Feature
	{
		public {Feature}Feature(ISystemFactory systemFactory)
		{
			Add(systemFactory.Create<{System1}>());
			Add(systemFactory.Create<{System2}>());
			// ... ordered pipeline
		}
	}
}
```

### 4. Register in GameplayCoreFeature

Find `GameplayCoreFeature.cs` and add the new feature in the correct position.

```csharp
Add(systemFactory.Create<{Feature}Feature>());
```

**Ordering principles:**
1. Events must be ready before systems consume them.
2. Input before gameplay logic.
3. State changes before view updates.
4. Cleanup systems always last.

## Rules

- Use **tabs** for indentation (size 4), never spaces.
- A Feature is a **pipeline** — systems are ordered to tell a story.
- The order should read naturally without comments.
- Producer systems before consumer systems.
- Class must be `sealed`.
- Namespace mirrors folder: `namespace Code.Gameplay.{Feature}`.
